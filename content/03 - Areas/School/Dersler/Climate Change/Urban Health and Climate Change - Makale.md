# Urban Health and Climate Change: Key Impacts and Responses in Cities

> *Grup Makalesi - Climate Change Dersi*

---

Climate change is reshaping health risks in cities through rising heat, worsening air quality, flooding, and shifting infectious diseases, with the greatest burden on vulnerable urban residents. Research also highlights that well-designed climate actions in cities can bring substantial **health co-benefits**, but current policies underuse this potential.

## Major Urban Health Impacts

- **Heat & air pollution:** Urban heat islands amplify heatwaves, driving excess mortality, cardiovascular and respiratory disease, and mental health impacts, especially among the elderly and chronically ill (Ligsay et al., 2021; Harlan & Ruddell, 2011; Agache et al., 2022; Bartholy & Pongrácz, 2018; Matte et al., 2024).  
- **Infectious disease & water/food safety:** Warming, flooding, and water stress increase mosquito-borne diseases (e.g., dengue) and waterborne infections, often concentrated in dense urban areas and informal settlements (Ligsay et al., 2021; Das et al., 2025; Borg et al., 2021; Kumar et al., 2024; Caminade et al., 2018).  
- **Inequality & informal settlements:** Poor, marginalized, and slum residents face disproportionate impacts due to inadequate housing, infrastructure, and healthcare (Ligsay et al., 2021; Jing & He, 2025; Das et al., 2025; Borg et al., 2021; Hoeben et al., 2022; Araos et al., 2016).

## Adaptation Strategies and Health Co‑Benefits

### Examples of urban measures and health links

| Strategy type | Main health effects | Notes | Citations |
|---------------|---------------------|--------|-----------|
| Urban greening, cool surfaces | Less heat stress, better air, mental health | May also cut ozone; pollen allergies possible | (Harlan & Ruddell, 2011; Sharifi et al., 2021; Trájer et al., 2022; Cheng & Berry, 2012) |
| Active & public transport | Less air pollution, obesity, CVD; better mental health | Strong mitigation–health co-benefits | (Sharifi et al., 2021; Becvarik et al., 2024; Cheng & Berry, 2012) |
| Heat/air warning systems | Reduced mortality in heatwaves, pollution peaks | Among best-documented benefits | (Harlan & Ruddell, 2011; Agache et al., 2022; Matte et al., 2024; Araos et al., 2016) |
| Critical infrastructure & flood management | Fewer injuries, infections, mental trauma | Key for coastal/riverine cities | (Sharifi et al., 2021; Borg et al., 2021; Matte et al., 2024) |

## Governance, Policy Gaps, and Equity

- Only ~10% of large cities report explicit public-health adaptation initiatives, mostly focused on extreme weather; infectious disease, mental health, and equity are often neglected (Borg et al., 2021; Hoeben et al., 2022; Araos et al., 2016).  
- Health is weakly integrated in many urban climate plans, and responsibilities are fragmented across sectors and levels of government (Ligsay et al., 2021; De Sario et al., 2025; Hoeben et al., 2022; Araos et al., 2016).  
- Reviews stress **community-driven, participatory urban regeneration** to address diverse vulnerabilities and avoid maladaptation (e.g., AC-driven emissions, green-space allergens, vector risks) (Ligsay et al., 2021; Kyprianou et al., 2023; Sharifi et al., 2021; Becvarik et al., 2024; Cheng & Berry, 2012; De Sario et al., 2025).

## Summary

Climate change intensifies urban health risks through heat, pollution, flooding, and infectious disease, hitting disadvantaged communities hardest. Yet many adaptation and mitigation measures—urban greening, active transport, resilient infrastructure, and early warning systems—can simultaneously cut emissions and improve health. The main challenges are integrating health and equity into city climate policy, closing evidence gaps in informal settlements and mental health, and scaling participatory, cross-sector approaches that maximize co-benefits while minimizing trade-offs.
