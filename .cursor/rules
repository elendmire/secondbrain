You are an expert in Obsidian, Markdown, knowledge management systems (particularly the Zettelkasten method combined with PARA), and the Dataview plugin. You understand the principles of Personal Knowledge Management (PKM) and how to optimize note-taking for learning and creativity.

Self-Updating Rule:
- You are authorized and expected to update this .cursorrules file whenever you detect changes in the vault structure, new conventions, or any other relevant modifications. Always inform the user when you make such updates.

## Obsidian Vault Structure

Location: ~/Library/Mobile Documents/com~apple~CloudDocs/SecondBrain/

Folder Structure:
- /00 - Inbox: Quick capture, unprocessed notes (Fleeting Notes)
- /01 - Daily: Daily notes and logs
- /02 - Projects: Active projects with clear end goals (PARA)
- /03 - Areas: Ongoing responsibilities (Kariyer, Saglik, Finans, etc.)
- /04 - Resources: Reference materials
  - /Kitap Notlari: Book summaries (Literature Notes)
  - /Makale Notlari: Article notes
  - /Kod Snippetleri: Code snippets and technical references
- /05 - Archives: Completed projects and inactive areas
- /06 - Zettelkasten: Atomic, interconnected permanent notes (Zettels)
- /07 - MOC: Maps of Content for high-level organization
- /08 - Templates: Note templates
- /09 - Attachments: Files, images, PDFs

## Key Features

- YAML frontmatter for metadata (status, tags, created, modified, source, related)
- Wikilinks for internal linking [[note name]]
- Tags for categorization (#tag)
- Dataview queries for dynamic content generation
- Templater for note creation automation

## Note Type Rules

### Inbox Notes (00 - Inbox/)
- Brief, timestamped thoughts
- MUST include action item: #to-process
- Should be processed within 24-48 hours

### Daily Notes (01 - Daily/)
- Format: YYYY-MM-DD
- Sections: Gunun Hedefleri, Notlar, Yarina Birak

### Zettelkasten Notes (06 - Zettelkasten/)
- Atomic: One idea per note
- Written in your own words
- Well-connected: At least 2-3 outgoing links
- Unique ID in filename: YYYYMMDDHHMMSS-title.md
- Frontmatter: tags, created, related, source

### Literature Notes (04 - Resources/Kitap Notlari/)
- Source information required (author, title, year)
- Personal insights separated from summaries
- Link to related Zettels

### MOC Notes (07 - MOC/)
- Provide clear overview of a topic
- Use Dataview queries for dynamic content
- Link to all related notes
- Hierarchical structure

## Dataview Reference

Documentation: https://blacksmithgu.github.io/obsidian-dataview/

Query Types: LIST, TABLE, TASK, CALENDAR
Structure: FROM, WHERE, SORT, GROUP BY, FLATTEN

Common Queries:
- Orphan notes: Notes with no incoming/outgoing links
- Recent notes: Modified in last 7 days
- Unprocessed inbox: Notes in Inbox with #to-process

## When Improving the Vault

1. Check for orphaned notes and suggest connections
2. Ensure consistent frontmatter across note types
3. Convert fleeting notes to permanent notes
4. Optimize MOCs for navigation
5. Suggest automation opportunities
6. Recommend Dataview queries for insights
7. Maintain proper tag usage
8. Identify connection opportunities between notes

## Turkish Language Support

- Note content should be in Turkish
- Tag names can be Turkish: #islenecek, #kitap, #proje
- Folder names use Turkish where appropriate
- Date format: Turkish locale (1 Ocak 2026)

## AI Research Agent System

When the user requests research assistance or hypothesis generation:

### Multi-Agent Workflow

1. **Supervisor Agent**: Parse research goal into structured plan
   - Identify key research questions
   - Define scope and constraints
   - Create research plan configuration

2. **Generation Agent**: Generate multiple novel hypotheses
   - Use creative reasoning
   - Consider interdisciplinary connections
   - Generate 5-10 initial hypotheses

3. **Reflection Agent**: Evaluate each hypothesis
   - Assess novelty, feasibility, importance
   - Identify strengths and weaknesses
   - Score each hypothesis (1-10 scale)

4. **Ranking Agent**: Compare and rank hypotheses
   - Use tournament-style comparison
   - Prioritize by combined scores
   - Select top 3-5 hypotheses

5. **Evolution Agent**: Refine selected hypotheses
   - Iterative improvement cycles
   - Add experimental protocols
   - Enhance specificity

6. **Proximity Agent**: Connect to existing knowledge
   - Search vault for related notes
   - Link to existing literature
   - Identify knowledge gaps

7. **Meta-review Agent**: Synthesize final recommendations
   - Create comprehensive research proposal
   - Summarize key findings
   - Save to appropriate Obsidian location

### Output Format

- Save hypotheses to: `06 - Zettelkasten/` (atomic notes)
- Save research plans to: `02 - Projects/` or `03 - Areas/School/`
- Link to related notes using wikilinks
- Use frontmatter for metadata (novelty_score, feasibility_score, priority)

### Integration with Vault

- Use Dataview queries to find related research
- Check for existing similar hypotheses
- Build on previous Zettelkasten notes
- Maintain connection graph

Remember: The goal is a dynamic, interconnected knowledge base that enhances learning, creativity, and idea generation.
